\chapter{Technology Review}
In this chapter I will review the technology behind Machine Learning up to today's state of the art.

\subsection{What is machine learning?}
Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in signifcant amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things such as numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm. Machine learning is behind the scenes of many of the products we use in our daily lives like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.
