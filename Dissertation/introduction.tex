Fake news (also known as junk news, pseudo-news, or hoax news) is a form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional news media
(print and broadcast) or online social media.Digital news has brought back and increased the usage of fake news, or yellow journalism.The news is then often reverberated
as misinformation in social media but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well.

The main aim behind fake news is to mislead and sway public opinion surrounding an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist,
dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership. Similarly, clickbait stories and headlines earn advertising revenue from this activity Fake news undermines proper
news coverage and makes it more difficult for journalists to cover signifigant news stories. The term `fake news' became very popular in 2016 when during and after his presidential
campaign and election, Donald Trump popularized the term `fake news' in this sense, regardless of the truthfulness of the news, when he used it to describe the negative press coverage of himself.
