\chapter{Methodology}

In order to aid in the detecting of fake news on the internet, I propose a solution in the form of a browser extension. Within this brower extension a model trained in the detecting of fake news 
will aid the user by highlighting articles, pieces of text and media that the model thinks has a high probability of being fake. I aim to do this in a non intrusive way that adds value to the users
browsing experience. The extension will be quick and easy to install.
