## Description
Hello and welcome to this GitHub repo that contains all the code and dissertation for my final year project. This project is about creating ML models that can predict fake news. The model will be deployed to the cloud and users can interact with it via a chrome extension. This is still under active development so not all features are present.

## Getting Started

To get started just clone this repo or you can use gitpod to load the project in an online virtual enviroment</br>
LINK TO GITPOD =====> https://www.gitpod.io/.

gitpod is really neat and I'd recommne checking this out.

### Prerequisites

Jupyter notebooks =====> https://jupyter.org/ </br>
Anaconda ======> https://www.anaconda.com/ </br>
:warning: You can install jupyter notebooks through anaconda so check out anaconda first!

### How to Run Notebooks
You should have jupyter notebooks installed. Easiest way to do this is to download and run anaconda on your machine that way you can get jupyter notebooks plus a ton of other goodies! Alternatively you can use gitpod and just install the requirments from the command line using

    conda install --yes --file requirements.txt

This will install the dependencies to your conda enviroment. </br>

:bangbang: If one dependency fails then all will fail. This can happen very rarely. To get around this problem please try =>

    while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements.txt

### How to Run Scripts


#### Running the jupyter notebooks
For anyone reading this not familiar with jupyter notebooks, jupyter notebooks will not run like regular python files/scripts. You will need jupyter notebooks installed on your system. To run the notebooks you can just type the command below in the directory of your files or type the command anywhere and just use the gui to move to the files.
        
        jupyter notebook 
        
You can then view and run the notebooks in the browser. </br>
